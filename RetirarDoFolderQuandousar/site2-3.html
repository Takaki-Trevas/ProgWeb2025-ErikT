                <h1>Bomber aircraft</h1>
                <p>A bomber is a military combat aircraft that have the biggest load capacity of ordnances like bombs, guided bombs, torpedoes, and air-launched cruise missiles.</p>

                <p>There are two major classifications of bomber: strategic and tactical. Strategic bombing is done by heavy bombers primarily designed for long-range bombing missions against strategic targets to diminish the enemy's ability to wage war by limiting access to resources through crippling infrastructure, reducing industrial output, or inflicting massive civilian casualties to an extent deemed to force surrender. Tactical bombing is aimed at countering enemy military activity and in supporting offensive operations, and is typically assigned to smaller aircraft (most of the time this task is carried by Attack aircraft) operating at shorter ranges, typically near the troops on the ground or against enemy shipping.</p>
